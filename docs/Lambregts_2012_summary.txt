**Study Aim**
To objectify and confirm the diagnostic value of nodal signal intensity (SI) and the 'chemical shift' artifact on gadofosveset trisodium-enhanced MRI for the detection of metastatic lymph nodes in rectal cancer.

**Methods**
*   **Study Design:** Retrospective, node-by-node validation study.
*   **Patient Population:** A random sample of 33 patients (from a previous cohort of 68) with biopsy-proven rectal adenocarcinoma. The cohort included patients who underwent immediate surgery and patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT).
*   **Imaging Protocol:** Non-enhanced and gadofosveset-enhanced 3D T1-weighted GRE MRI at 1.5T.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Quantitative:** For each lymph node, SI was measured in the middle part of the node (mSI) and in the white rim of the chemical shift artifact (wSI) on both pre- and post-contrast images. The percentage increase in SI (ΔSI) was calculated.
    *   **Qualitative (Chemical Shift Criterion):** The appearance of the chemical shift artifact was categorized by two readers into four types: 1) clearly visible, sharp 'relief sign'; 2) irregular/interrupted border; 3) 'flat' appearance with no enhancement; 4) marked rim enhancement.
    *   **Subjective:** Two radiologists performed a visual assessment, scoring the likelihood of malignancy on a 5-point scale based on an overall impression of SI and the chemical shift artifact.
*   **Reference Standard:** Node-by-node histopathological evaluation.

**Key Results (beyond Abstract)**
*   **Nodal Cohort:** 289 nodes were matched with pathology (55 N+, 234 N-).
*   **Signal Intensity (SI) Characteristics:**
    *   On post-contrast images, the SI was **significantly higher in benign nodes** than metastatic nodes for both the middle part (mSI: 1.53 vs 1.24, p<0.001) and the white rim (wSI: 2.59 vs 2.31, p<0.001).
    *   The percentage increase in SI (ΔmSI) after contrast was significantly higher for benign nodes (58%) compared to metastatic nodes (25%) (p<0.001).
    *   The AUC for post-contrast mSI alone was 0.74.

*   **Chemical Shift Criterion:**
    *   The qualitative assessment of the chemical shift artifact alone yielded an **AUC of 0.85**.
    *   A normal, sharp 'relief sign' (Type 1) was present in **96% of benign nodes** but only in **27% of metastatic nodes**.
    *   Conversely, an irregular border (Type 2) or marked rim enhancement (Type 4) were far more common in metastatic nodes (30% and 30%, respectively) than in benign nodes (3% and 0.5%).

*   **Combined Criteria and Visual Assessment:**
    *   Combining the post-contrast mSI with the chemical shift criterion significantly improved performance, yielding an **AUC of 0.88**.
    *   Adding nodal size to this combination did not result in a significant improvement (AUC remained 0.88).
    *   The subjective visual assessment by an experienced and a less experienced radiologist rendered the highest diagnostic performance, with **AUCs of 0.92 and 0.86**, respectively. This demonstrates that the combined features can be reliably assessed visually.

**Conclusion**
Gadofosveset-enhanced MRI provides high diagnostic performance for rectal cancer nodal staging, superior to conventional size-based criteria. The mechanism is twofold: 1) benign lymph nodes show significant contrast uptake, while metastatic nodes do not; 2) this differential uptake enhances the 'chemical shift artifact' around benign nodes (the 'relief sign') but not around metastatic nodes. The combination of these two features provides the best objective accuracy, and importantly, these features can be integrated into a highly accurate and reproducible subjective visual assessment, making it a promising tool for clinical practice.
