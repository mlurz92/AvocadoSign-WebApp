### Rutegård et al. (2025) - Evaluation of ESGAR Criteria

*   **Purpose:** To evaluate the performance of current MRI-based criteria for malignancy, specifically the 2016 ESGAR consensus criteria, in anatomically matched mesorectal nodal structures (lymph nodes, tumour deposits, and EMVI).

*   **Methods:** A prospective study including 458 anatomically matched nodal structures from 46 rectal cancer patients. Baseline MRI findings were compared to the histopathological gold standard. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to evaluate morphological criteria.

*   **Nodal Malignancy Criteria Evaluated (ESGAR 2016):**
    *   Short axis < 5 mm: requires 3 suspicious features (round shape, irregular margin, heterogeneous signal).
    *   Short axis 5–8 mm: requires 2 suspicious features.
    *   Short axis ≥ 9 mm: considered malignant regardless of features.

*   **Key Findings:**
    *   **Individual Features:** In univariable analysis, the strongest predictors of malignancy were a short-axis diameter ≥ 5 mm (OR 21.43) and heterogeneous signal (OR 9.02). Round shape was not statistically significant. In multivariable analysis, only size (≥ 5 mm) remained significant (OR 12.32).
    *   **ESGAR Criteria Performance:** When the combined ESGAR criteria were applied as a binary test, a positive result had an odds ratio of 8.23 for malignancy. The criteria yielded a **sensitivity of 54%** and a **specificity of 85%**.
    *   **Nodal Structure Identity:** 44% of structures identified as lymph nodes on MRI were histopathologically proven to be tumour deposits (TDs) or nodular extramural venous invasion (EMVI).
    *   **Comet Tail Sign:** This feature, proposed as a sign of TDs, was not significantly associated with malignant outcomes.

*   **Conclusion:** The study confirms a statistical association between the ESGAR criteria and malignant outcomes. However, the criteria demonstrate low sensitivity and may not be accurate enough for definitive nodal staging. The inability to reliably differentiate lymph nodes from other malignant nodal structures like TDs and EMVI remains a significant challenge.
