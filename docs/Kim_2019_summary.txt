**Study Aim**
To evaluate whether a combination model using metabolic parameters from both the primary tumor and the lymph nodes on pretreatment [18F]FDG PET/CT could improve the prediction of nodal metastases in rectal cancer.

**Methods**
*   **Study Design:** Retrospective analysis.
*   **Patient Population:** 166 rectal cancer patients who underwent pretreatment PET/CT and surgical resection without neoadjuvant therapy.
*   **PET/CT Analysis:** Visual and semiquantitative parameters were obtained.
    *   **Primary Tumor:** Metabolic Tumor Volume (T_MTV) and maximum Standardized Uptake Value (T_SUVmax).
    *   **Lymph Nodes:** Maximum Standardized Uptake Value of the most active lymph node (N_SUVmax).
*   **Reference Standard:** Histological confirmation of nodal metastases in the resected specimen.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Uni- and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify independent predictors. A nomogram was created, and the performance of different models was compared using c-statistics (AUC).

**Key Results (beyond Abstract)**
*   **Prevalence:** Nodal metastases were confirmed in 68 of 166 patients (41%).
*   **Performance of Standard PET/CT Assessment:**
    *   Visual assessment of nodal FDG uptake alone had a **sensitivity of 48.5%** and a **specificity of 93.9%**.
    *   This shows high specificity (if a node is hot, it's likely malignant) but very low sensitivity (many malignant nodes are not hot).
    *   Of 39 patients with positive nodal uptake, 33 (84.6%) were truly N+. However, of 127 patients with negative nodal uptake, 35 (27.6%) were actually N+ (false negatives).

*   **Independent Predictors of Nodal Metastasis:**
    *   On multivariate analysis, both the metabolic activity of the primary tumor (**T_MTV**) and the metabolic activity of the lymph node (**N_SUVmax**) were identified as **independent predictive factors**.
    *   **T_MTV:** OR 1.022 (95% CI, 1.001–1.043), p=0.038. This means a larger, more metabolically active primary tumor is independently associated with a higher risk of having nodal metastases.
    *   **N_SUVmax:** OR 2.181 (95% CI, 1.523–3.125), p<0.001.

*   **Performance of the Combination Model:**
    *   A prediction model combining **T_MTV + N_SUVmax** was developed.
    *   The predictive performance (AUC) of this combination model was **0.806**.
    *   This was a **statistically significant improvement** compared to using T_MTV alone (AUC 0.698, p=0.0002) or N_SUVmax alone (AUC 0.720, p=0.0008).
    *   A nomogram was created to allow for easy clinical application of the combined model to predict the probability of LN metastasis for an individual patient.

**Conclusion**
Standard visual or SUVmax-based assessment of lymph nodes on PET/CT has low sensitivity for detecting metastases in rectal cancer. This study demonstrates that the metabolic activity of the primary tumor (specifically T_MTV) is an independent predictor of nodal status, likely reflecting tumor aggressiveness. By creating a combination model that incorporates both the metabolic activity of the primary tumor (**T_MTV**) and the most avid lymph node (**N_SUVmax**), the predictive performance for nodal metastasis is **significantly improved** over using either parameter alone. This combined PET/CT model could serve as a more accurate, non-invasive tool for pretreatment risk stratification and treatment planning in rectal cancer.
