### Barbaro et al. (2024) - Nodal Assessment After nCRT

*   **Purpose:** To evaluate the accuracy of MRI in identifying negative N status (ypN0) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT).

*   **Methods:** A retrospective, single-center study of 191 LARC patients who underwent MRI before and 6–8 weeks after nCRT, followed by surgery. The short-axis diameter of mesorectal lymph nodes on T2-weighted images was evaluated and compared with histopathology.

*   **Nodal Malignancy Criteria (Restaging):** The study evaluated three quantitative MRI criteria to predict a final ypN0 status:
    1.  Complete disappearance of nodes on restaging MRI.
    2.  A specific cut-off for the short-axis diameter of residual nodes.
    3.  The percentage of size reduction in the largest identifiable lymph node.

*   **Key Findings:**
    *   **Node Disappearance:** In 38 patients, no nodes were visible on restaging MRI. 37 of these (97.4%) were confirmed as ypN0 at pathology. This criterion had a **sensitivity of 93.3%** and a **negative predictive value (NPV) of 92.5%** for predicting ypN0 status.
    *   **Size Cut-off:** A post-nCRT short-axis diameter of **≤ 2.2 mm** was the optimal cut-off for predicting ypN0 status, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.83, a sensitivity of 79.5%, and an NPV of 91.1%.
    *   **Size Reduction:** A **≥ 70% reduction in the short-axis diameter of the largest node** was associated with an AUC of 0.818 for predicting ypN0 status. This criterion demonstrated a **sensitivity of 93.3%** and an **NPV of 95.4%**.

*   **Conclusion:** A 70% reduction in the size of the largest node on restaging MRI has high sensitivity and NPV for predicting a ypN0 stage after nCRT. The study also confirms the high NPV of both complete node disappearance and a residual short-axis diameter of ≤ 2.2 mm.
