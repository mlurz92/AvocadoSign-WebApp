### Lurz and Schäfer (2025) - The Avocado Sign

*   **Purpose:** To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the "Avocado Sign," a novel contrast-enhancement-based MRI marker, for predicting mesorectal lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer.

*   **Methods:** A retrospective, single-institution study of 106 patients. All patients underwent MRI with a gadolinium-based contrast agent. 77 patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) and had a restaging MRI. Histopathology served as the reference standard.

*   **Nodal Malignancy Criteria (The Avocado Sign):**
    *   The sign is defined as a **hypointense core within an otherwise homogeneously hyperintense lymph node on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted fat-saturated images**.
    *   It is assessed in all visible mesorectal lymph nodes, regardless of their size or shape.
    *   If the sign is present in at least one node, the patient's nodal status is considered positive.

*   **Key Findings:**
    *   **Overall Performance (n=106):** The Avocado Sign demonstrated a **sensitivity of 88.7%**, **specificity of 84.9%**, PPV of 85.5%, NPV of 88.2%, and an overall accuracy of 86.8%. The AUC was 0.87.
    *   **Surgery-Alone Subgroup (n=29):** The sign showed a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 83.3%, and an AUC of 0.92.
    *   **Neoadjuvant Therapy Subgroup (n=77):** In the restaging setting, the sign had a sensitivity of 84.2%, specificity of 85.4%, and an AUC of 0.85.
    *   **Reproducibility:** Interobserver agreement for assessing the sign was almost perfect (Cohen’s kappa = 0.92).

*   **Conclusion:** The Avocado Sign is a promising and highly reproducible imaging predictor for mesorectal lymph node status in rectal cancer. Its high diagnostic accuracy suggests that incorporating contrast-enhanced sequences into MRI protocols could refine nodal staging and improve patient stratification for different treatment strategies.
