## **1. Overview**

### **1.1. Purpose and Scope**

The **Nodal Staging: Avocado Sign vs. T2 Criteria** analysis tool is a sophisticated, client-side web application engineered for advanced scientific research in the radiological diagnosis of rectal cancer. It provides a powerful, interactive platform for researchers and clinicians to conduct in-depth analyses and detailed comparisons of various MRI-based criteria for assessing mesorectal lymph node status (N-status).

The application's primary function is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the novel "Avocado Sign" (AS) against both established literature-based and data-driven, cohort-optimized T2-weighted (T2w) morphological criteria. It is designed to be a comprehensive research environment, from data exploration to manuscript preparation.

### **1.2. Target Audience**

This tool is intended for:
* **Medical Researchers:** Specifically in radiology, surgical oncology, and radiation therapy, for evaluating and comparing diagnostic staging methods.
* **Radiologists:** For the development, validation, and educational exploration of MRI criteria in rectal cancer staging.
* **Medical Statisticians & Data Analysts:** For evaluating diagnostic test accuracy and modeling predictive markers.
* **Authors of Scientific Publications:** To assist in the preparation of data, figures, tables, and text for submission to peer-reviewed journals.

### **1.3. Core Principle: Research-Only Instrument**

**Disclaimer:** This application is intended strictly for **research and educational purposes only**. The data, statistics, visualizations, and generated text are derived from a static, pseudonymized research dataset. **The output is not intended for, and must not be used for, clinical diagnosis, direct patient treatment decisions, or any other primary medical applications.** All interpretations must be made within the context of the underlying research data and its limitations. The scientific and clinical responsibility for the use of any generated results lies entirely with the user.

### **1.4. Underlying Dataset**

The application operates on a fixed, integrated, and pseudonymized dataset comprising **106 patient cases** with histologically confirmed rectal cancer. This dataset includes clinical information (age, sex, therapy group), the histopathologically confirmed N-status, findings for the Avocado Sign, and detailed morphological data for individual T2-weighted lymph nodes.

## **2. Getting Started**

### **2.1. System Requirements**

The application is a self-contained web application and requires no installation. It is designed to run on any modern desktop web browser that supports standard HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Recommended Browsers:** Latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Safari.

### **2.2. Accessing the Application**

To run the tool, simply open the `index.html` file in a compatible web browser. An active internet connection is required to load external libraries (e.g., Bootstrap, D3.js) from their respective CDNs.

## **3. Global User Interface Concepts**

The application's interface is designed for an intuitive and efficient workflow, governed by several global concepts.

### **3.1. Main Layout**

The UI is divided into three persistent sections:
* **Header:** Contains the application title, global cohort selection controls, and dynamic meta-statistics.
* **Tab Navigation Bar:** Provides access to the six main functional modules of the application.
* **Content Area:** The main workspace where the content of the selected tab is rendered.

### **3.2. Global Cohort Selection**

This is a primary control concept. A group of three buttons in the header allows the user to filter the entire dataset for analysis:
* **Overall:** Includes all 106 patients.
* **Surgery alone:** Filters for patients who received upfront surgery without neoadjuvant therapy.
* **Neoadjuvant therapy:** Filters for patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nRCT) prior to surgery.

This selection is **global** and instantly affects all data, tables, charts, and statistical calculations across all tabs of the application. The currently active cohort button is highlighted with a solid background.

### **3.3. Dynamic Header Statistics**

Located in the header, this panel provides an at-a-glance summary of the currently selected cohort:
* **Cohort:** Name of the active cohort.
* **Patients:** Total number of patients in the active cohort.
* **N-Status, AS-Status, T2-Status:** The percentage of patients within the cohort who are positive for the pathological N-status, the Avocado Sign, and the currently applied T2 criteria, respectively.

### **3.4. Interactive Help & Guidance**

* **Tooltips:** Most UI elements (buttons, headers, metrics) are equipped with detailed tooltips. Hovering over an element reveals a concise explanation of its function or the definition of a metric.
* **Quick Guide:** A dedicated button with a question mark icon (`?`) in the header opens a comprehensive modal window. This guide explains all application features, core concepts, and provides a glossary of terms.

## **4. Application Modules (Tabs)**

The application's functionality is organized into six distinct modules, accessible via the main navigation tabs.

### **4.1. Data Tab**

* **Purpose:** To display and explore the raw, underlying patient data for the selected cohort.
* **Key Components & Workflow:**
    * **Patient Table:** A sortable table listing all patients in the current cohort. Columns include ID, Name, Sex, Age, Therapy, a combined N/AS/T2 status indicator, and Notes.
    * **Sorting:** All columns are sortable by clicking the header. The "N/AS/T2" column supports sub-sorting by clicking directly on the "N", "AS", or "T2" labels within the header. The active sort criterion is indicated by an up/down arrow icon.
    * **Expandable Detail View:** Rows for patients with available T2 lymph node data are expandable. Clicking a row reveals a detailed list of that patient's individual T2 nodes and their morphological properties (Size, Shape, Border, etc.), each visualized with a corresponding icon.
    * **"Expand/Collapse All" Button:** A convenience button to toggle the detail view for all patients in the table simultaneously.

### **4.2. Analysis Tab**

* **Purpose:** The central interactive workspace for defining T2 criteria, finding optimal criteria via brute-force analysis, and examining the impact on individual patients.
* **Key Components & Workflow:**
    1.  **Dashboard:** A set of cards at the top provides a quick graphical overview of the cohort's distribution by Age, Sex, Therapy, and the prevalence of N+, AS+, and T2+ statuses.
    2.  **Define T2 Malignancy Criteria Card:** This is the main interactive component for criteria definition.
        * **Activation:** Each of the five T2 features (Size, Shape, Border, Homogeneity, Signal) can be included or excluded from the analysis by toggling its respective checkbox.
        * **Value Selection:** For active criteria, the user specifies what is considered suspicious. For "Size", this is done via a responsive slider and a synchronized manual input box. For categorical features like "Shape", the user clicks buttons representing the options (e.g., "round", "oval").
        * **Logic Switch:** A prominent switch toggles the logical operator between **AND** (a node is positive only if *all* active criteria are met) and **OR** (a node is positive if *at least one* active criterion is met).
        * **Unsaved Changes Indicator:** The card's border will flash and show a tooltip if changes have been made but not yet applied, preventing user error.
        * **Action Buttons:**
            * `Reset to Default`: Reverts all interactive criteria controls to their original default state.
            * `Apply & Save`: Commits the currently configured criteria and logic. This action updates the T2 status for all patients and recalculates all dependent statistics and charts throughout the entire application. The settings are also saved to `localStorage` for future sessions.
    3.  **Diagnostic Performance (Applied T2) Card:** This card automatically updates after criteria are applied, showing a full table of diagnostic performance metrics (Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, NPV, Accuracy, AUC, etc.) with 95% Confidence Intervals for the applied T2 criteria versus the pathological N-status.
    4.  **Criteria Optimization (Brute-Force) Card:** This powerful tool automates the search for the best-performing T2 criteria.
        * **Workflow:** The user selects a target metric to optimize (e.g., "Balanced Accuracy") from a dropdown and clicks "Start".
        * **Background Processing:** A Web Worker is initiated to test thousands of possible criteria combinations without freezing the UI.
        * **Real-time Progress:** The card's content is replaced by a progress bar showing the percentage of completed combinations, along with the best result found so far. The process can be cancelled at any time.
        * **Results:** Upon completion, the card displays a summary of the best criteria set found, its logic, and the achieved metric value. A "Top 10" button opens a modal with a detailed ranked list of the best results.
        * `Apply Best Criteria`: A button allows the user to instantly load the optimal criteria found by the algorithm into the "Define T2 Malignancy Criteria" card.
    5.  **Analysis Table:** Similar to the Data Tab, but focused on evaluation. It shows the N/AS/T2 status and lymph node counts for each patient. Expanding a row reveals a detailed breakdown of how each T2 node was evaluated against the *currently applied* criteria, visually highlighting the specific features that led to a positive or negative classification.

### **4.3. Statistics Tab**

* **Purpose:** To provide a comprehensive and formal statistical evaluation of the diagnostic methods.
* **Key Components & Workflow:**
    * **Layout Toggle:** A primary control switches the tab between two modes:
        * **Single View:** A deep dive into the statistics of the single, globally selected cohort.
        * **Comparison Active:** Enables two dropdowns to select any two cohorts for a side-by-side statistical comparison.
    * **Statistical Cards:** The tab is populated with a series of cards, each presenting a different aspect of the analysis:
        * **Descriptive Statistics:** Tables and charts showing cohort demographics.
        * **Diagnostic Performance:** Separate, detailed tables for Avocado Sign (vs. N-status) and the applied T2 criteria (vs. N-status), including all standard metrics with 95% CIs.
        * **Statistical Comparison:** Paired test results (McNemar's for accuracy, DeLong's for AUC) comparing AS directly with the applied T2 criteria within the same cohort.
        * **Association Analysis:** An exploratory table showing the statistical association (Odds Ratio, Risk Difference) of individual features with the final N-status.
    * **Criteria Comparison Table:** A summary table comparing the key performance metrics of the Avocado Sign, the user's applied T2 criteria, and several predefined criteria sets from scientific literature.

### **4.4. Presentation Tab**

* **Purpose:** To generate clean, visually appealing summaries of the results suitable for inclusion in scientific presentations.
* **Key Components & Workflow:**
    * **View Selection:** Radio buttons allow the user to choose between two presentation formats:
        * **AS Performance:** Focuses solely on the performance of the Avocado Sign across all cohorts.
        * **AS vs. T2 Comparison:** A direct comparison of the Avocado Sign against a chosen T2 criteria set.
    * **T2 Comparison Basis:** In the comparison view, a dropdown menu allows the user to select the T2 criteria to be compared against AS. This can be the user's own currently applied criteria or any of the predefined literature sets.
    * **Dynamic Content Generation:** The view dynamically populates with info cards detailing the chosen comparison basis, data tables, statistical test results, and a grouped bar chart visualizing the performance differences.
    * **Export Functions:** All tables and charts have dedicated buttons for direct download as CSV, Markdown, PNG, or SVG files.

### **4.5. Publication Tab**

* **Purpose:** To assist in the creation of a scientific manuscript by generating publication-ready text, tables, and figures adhering to the style guidelines of the journal *Radiology*.
* **Key Components & Workflow:**
    * **Section Navigation:** A sidebar lists the standard sections of a research paper (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References). Clicking a section loads the corresponding content.
    * **Dynamic Text Generation:** The application generates professionally formulated, academic English text for each section. This text is not static; it dynamically integrates the latest data and statistical results from the user's current analysis session, correctly formatted according to journal standards (e.g., *P* < .001, 95% CIs, etc.).
    * **Embedded Content:** Tables and figure placeholders are embedded directly within the generated text flow, demonstrating how the final manuscript would be structured.
    * **BF Metric Selection:** A dropdown allows the user to select which brute-force optimization result should be referenced in the manuscript text, ensuring the narrative aligns with the chosen optimization goal.

### **4.6. Export Tab**

* **Purpose:** A centralized module for exporting all forms of data and results from the application.
* **Key Components & Workflow:**
    * **Export Categories:** The options are organized into "Single Exports" and "Export Packages (.zip)" for clarity.
    * **Context-Aware Exports:** All exports are generated based on the **currently selected global cohort** and the **last applied T2 criteria**. Buttons for exports that are not currently available (e.g., a brute-force report before an optimization has been run) are automatically disabled.
    * **Available Files:**
        * **Data & Tables:** Filtered raw data (CSV), data lists (Markdown), analysis tables (Markdown).
        * **Results:** A comprehensive statistics report (CSV), a detailed brute-force optimization report (TXT).
        * **Graphics Packages:** ZIP archives containing all currently visible charts and tables on the page as individual PNG or SVG files.
