# Radiology Scientific Style Guide: Original Article Manuscript Preparation

This guide consolidates stylistic guidelines for preparing an Original Article manuscript for submission to *Radiology*, aiming for clarity, conciseness, and completeness.

## 1. Manuscript Type & General Requirements
*   **Manuscript Type:** Focus on **Original Research** (word limit: 3000 words). Technical Developments (2000 words) follow a similar structure but with more limited Introduction and Discussion sections.
*   **Supplemental Material:** Online-only publication of supplemental material is available but will not be copyedited.
*   **General:** Refer to the official *Radiology* author instructions for other manuscript types.

## 2. Title
*   **Word Limit:** Maximum 15 words.
*   **Content:** Include the *modality* (for which body part), *disease*, and/or problem being studied.
*   **Conciseness:** Be concise.
*   **Optional:** If space allows, indicate study type (e.g., randomized clinical trial) and clinical trial or cohort name (e.g., DETERMINE, MESA).

## 3. Abbreviations
*   **List Limit:** Include a list of up to 10 standard abbreviations.
*   **Usage Frequency:** Each abbreviation in the list must appear at least ten times in the paper (from Introduction to Discussion). Otherwise, write them out and do not include them in the list.
*   **First Mention:** Define all abbreviations/acronyms at first mention in *both* the Abstract and the main text.
*   **Common Modalities:** Do not define common imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI, US, SPECT, PET).
*   **Adjusted Values:** Do not abbreviate adjusted values (e.g., aOR for adjusted odds ratio). Instead, write out the context, such as: "In the adjusted model, the OR was XX; after multivariable adjustment, the OR was XX."
*   **Key Sections:** Define/write out abbreviations in the Summary, Key Results, and the first and last paragraphs of the Discussion, as readers often look to these areas for a synopsis.

## 4. Summary Statement
*   **Word Limit:** Maximum 30 words.
*   **Content:** Provide a single sentence summarizing your findings that best conveys the message or emphasizes an important point of your study.
*   **Consistency:** If the title includes a modality and disease, the summary statement should also.

## 5. Key Results
*   **Word Limit:** Maximum 75 words.
*   **Content:** Include up to 3 main study results with summary data.
    *   Use past tense.
    *   Mention the type of study (e.g., retrospective, prospective, clinical trial).
    *   Mention the number of patients/participants, disease, and modality.
    *   Include percentages, ratios, and p-values. P-values need comparison values, such as odds ratios.
    *   **Do not include confidence intervals.**
*   **Clarity:** Avoid repeating the summary statement or using vague language.
*   **Visual Abstracts:** Key Results will translate directly to visual abstracts.

## 6. Abstract (300 words)
The abstract is the public "face" of your article and is crucial for initial evaluation. Be concise, specific, and avoid jargon.

### 6.1. Background
*   **Length:** One or two sentences (at most).
*   **Content:** State why the study was performed and/or why it is relevant. Frame it from a clinical radiologist's perspective (e.g., "Why is this study important to my radiology practice?").

### 6.2. Purpose
*   **Content:** Describe the research question you are trying to answer. This should be a brief, precise statement, essentially the same as your aim at the end of your main introduction.
*   **Consistency:** The purpose must fit your conclusion (e.g., if comparing diagnostic performance, do not mention survival outcomes in the conclusion).

### 6.3. Materials and Methods
*   **Study Type:** Name the study as retrospective, prospective, secondary analysis of a prospective trial, or randomized controlled trial in the first sentence.
    *   **Prospective Study:** Data collection planned before index test and reference standard. Participants enrolled with consent, data analysis, and outcomes specified beforehand. Patients are referred to as *participants*.
    *   **Secondary Analysis:** If the main prospective study did not include your study purpose in its original design.
    *   **Retrospective Study:** Examines exposures to suspected risk or protection factors related to an outcome established at the start of the study, using existing medical data. Patients are referred to as *patients*.
*   **Registered Studies:** For registered studies, provide the registry name and number (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01234567).
*   **Participants:**
    *   For animal studies, provide type and number.
    *   For human studies, the number, sex ratios, and ages go in the Results section.
    *   Specify the disease and groups compared (e.g., women with and without breast cancer).
*   **Study Dates:** Provide beginning and end dates of the study or participant accrual and follow-up (e.g., July 2019 to June 2020). Recent dates are preferred. Clearly state the length of any follow-up period(s).
*   **Multicenter Studies:** Emphasize multicenter studies by stating the number and type of institutions involved (e.g., tertiary care center, academic medical center).
*   **Reference Standard & Index Test:** Clearly state what the reference standard (best test currently available) and the index test (the test being evaluated) are.
*   **Modalities/Procedures:** Describe the modalities and procedures performed.
*   **Outcomes:** Describe pre-specified primary outcome measure(s), as well as secondary and other variables, interventions being compared, and treatment/control groups.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Provide a sentence on statistical analysis, summarizing the tests performed and descriptive statistics. Key statistical terms like "multivariable," "adjusted," or "independent/control variables" can make your study stand out.

### 6.4. Results
*   **First Sentence:** Indicate the number, sex, and mean age $\pm$ standard deviation (SD) or median age and interquartile range (IQR) of the patients/participants enrolled. Example: "100 patients (mean age, 47 years $\pm$ 10 [standard deviation], 60 men) were evaluated." Provide the sex of the larger number of patients.
*   **Data Presentation:**
    *   Provide numerical data and P-values for all comparisons (e.g., group A, 25 $\pm$ 4, group B 50 $\pm$ 5, p=.01).
    *   Include confidence intervals if appropriate (e.g., AUC, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.77; P < .001).
    *   Include numerator and denominator for percentages (e.g., sensitivity 20 of 25 (80%)).
    *   Focus on about three main results. Avoid obscuring key results with too many numbers. The results should be interpretable on their own without reference to the main paper. Provide labels and units for all numbers.

### 6.5. Conclusion
*   **Content:** Must correspond to the purpose statement and derive directly from the results.
*   **Avoid Elaboration:** Do not elaborate on the importance of the study or other implications.

## 7. Introduction (400 words)

### 7.1. Claims of Priority
*   **Wording:** If you must indicate novelty, use the phrase: "the finding of [whatever the finding is] has not previously been well established in the literature."
*   **Study Size:** If discussing study size, do not refer to your study as "the largest study to date." Instead, write: "large studies have not yet been performed on [whatever topic]."
*   **Frequency:** Only state these claims once in the introduction.

### 7.2. Hypotheses
*   **Applicability:** Only for prospective studies.
*   **Placement:** At the end of the introduction, mention any prespecified hypotheses before your purpose/aim.
*   **Exclusions:** Do not include a hypothesis for retrospective studies, meta-analysis/systematic review, or technical development papers.

## 8. Materials and Methods (800 words)
This section must be detailed enough for reproducibility.

### 8.1. Regulatory Approvals (First Paragraph)
In the first paragraph, name the study type (randomized trial, prospective, retrospective, secondary analysis) and include:
1.  Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee approval.
2.  Informed consent obtained (specify written, verbal) or waiver granted.
3.  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) approval (United States only).
4.  Animal Care Committee approval (animal studies only).
5.  Registry name and number (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01234567) for all randomized trials, prospective studies, and applicable secondary analyses.
6.  Any financial support from industry.

### 8.2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) / AI-Assisted Technologies
*   **Transparency:** If any AI or AI-assisted technologies (e.g., LLMs, chatbots, image creators) were used in manuscript preparation, authors must report how they used such tools.
*   **Details:** Provide information about their use, including the name and version of the AI tool, date of access, and name of the manufacturer or creator. This information should be in the Materials and Methods section, Acknowledgments, or relevant sections (e.g., figure legends for AI-generated figures).
*   **Computer Code (Required for AI Articles):** Deposit all computer code in a publicly accessible repository (e.g., Github, BitBucket, SourceForge). Provide a link to this code in the Materials and Methods.
*   **Datasets (for AI Articles):** Describe all datasets used (training, validation, internal test, external test). Each dataset should be independent, without overlap. Include a Dataset Characteristics Table and Flowchart.

### 8.3. Subheadings
Use appropriate subheadings for clarity, such as: Study Design and Patients/Participants, Definitions of Terms, Imaging Protocols, Image Analysis, Statistical Analysis.

### 8.4. Eligibility (Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria)
*   **Specificity:** Clearly state both inclusion and exclusion criteria.
*   **Identification:** Indicate where and when potentially eligible participants were identified, including location (single-center or multicenter, type of institution) and date range of study (beginning, end dates or participant accrual, follow-up, e.g., July 2020 to June 2021).
*   **Sample Selection:** Specify the sampling technique: nonprobability sampling (consecutive, convenience) or random sampling.
*   **Sample Size:** Indicate how the sample size was derived. A statement of justification of sample size and/or power calculation is strongly recommended.
*   **Overlap:** For retrospective studies, note any overlap in patients with other studies, even if in a different type of study with different outcome assessments. Reference all studies published or in press. Also, explain if there was a different analysis of data. If too many to reference, include a supplemental table.

### 8.5. Definitions of Key Terms
*   Consider including a separate section titled *Definitions of Terms*. This will also make your study more understandable to general radiologists. Move any long equations to the supplement for ease of reading.

### 8.6. Imaging Protocols
*   **Detail:** Be brief but include enough detail that the imaging could be repeated for the key sequences.
*   **MRI:** Include repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE). If more detail is needed, the full pulse sequence is likely better placed in an online supplement.
*   **CT:** Indicate contrast or non-contrast, plane, section thickness, and section interval.

### 8.7. Product Name and Manufacturer
*   **First Mention:** When first mentioned, identify any used instruments or drugs (including contrast) with brand/trade names and manufacturer’s name in parentheses.
*   **Subsequent Use:** Thereafter, use generic terms if information can be accurately conveyed. Data presentation should be unbiased and not promotional. If multiple brands of systems (e.g., MRI, CT) are used in the article, a table is suggested.

### 8.8. Diagnostic Accuracy Studies: Reference Standard and Index Test
*   **Clarity:** Clearly state your reference standard (the best method currently available to establish the presence or absence of a target condition) and index test (the procedure or test whose accuracy is being evaluated).
*   **Independence:** The index test and reference standard should be independent of each other.

### 8.9. Investigators and Readers/Evaluations
*   **Expertise:** Provide the number of readers and/or investigators, along with their expertise, and years of experience (for residents, indicate "in-training").
*   **Initials:** Provide initials for any authors. If those contributors are not authors, mention them in the Acknowledgments but obtain written permission. Nonauthor contributor initials should not appear in the text of the article.
*   **Software:** State if using automated or semiautomated software to analyze or complete postprocessing of images; provide software name, version, and manufacturer.
*   **Reading Process:** State if studies were read independently, if readings were randomly assigned, the use of any consensus agreements, and how disagreements, if any, were resolved.
*   **Variability:** For one/multiple readers, indicate how intra- or inter-reader variability was measured (e.g., $\kappa$ statistic, intraclass correlation coefficient) and how coefficients were interpreted (e.g., cutoff values for weak, moderate, strong). Note that single observer studies are discouraged, as are "consensus" reads.
*   **Blinding:** Mention anonymizing of data or images. Clearly state what readers were anonymized to, and what they were not anonymized to.
*   **Time Interval:** Provide the time interval between readout sessions to eliminate recall bias.

### 8.10. Subgroup Analysis
*   **Specification:** Mention if subgroup analysis was pre-specified (required for randomized controlled clinical trials) or post-hoc.
*   **Post-hoc:** If using a post-hoc analysis, address it in methods and include it as a limitation in the discussion.

### 8.11. Statistical Analysis
The last paragraph(s) of Materials and Methods should be titled *Statistical Analysis*.
*   **Tests:** State the statistical tests used, on what data, and for what determinations.
*   **P-value:** Provide the P-value used for significance (e.g., $P<.05$). For multiple comparisons, mention Bonferroni correction if applicable.
*   **Software:** Indicate statistical software used, including version and manufacturer.
*   **Analyst:** If the statistical analyst is an author, provide their initials.
*   **Sample Size/Power:** A statement of justification of sample size and/or power calculation is strongly recommended, especially in studies where the primary conclusion is of nonsignificance. Briefly mention power, significance, statistical test, and magnitude of effect.
*   **Metrics:** Avoid net reclassification index and integrated discrimination index for inferences regarding a new radiology imaging test being better than an old test. Traditional AUC analysis or change in standard metrics (e.g., test positivity rate) is sufficient. AUC is preferred to C-index.
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Use standard measures (e.g., percentages, means $\pm$ SDs; medians and IQRs).
*   **Inferential Statistics:** Include 95% CIs to indicate the range of likely values for key measures (required for AUC values, sensitivity, specificity, and for differences/effects in comparative studies).
*   **Multivariable Analysis:** Mention univariable and/or multivariable analysis. For multivariable analysis, distinguish between confounding variables you adjusted for (e.g., age, sex) and independent variables being investigated. Mention summary measures such as regression coefficients, correlations, odds ratios, and hazard ratios. If calculating hazard or odds ratios, mention reference categories.
*   **Matched Data:** Provide appropriate analysis for matched data.

## 9. Registered Studies and Data Sharing Statement
*   **Registry Information:** If your study is registered on a national or international database (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO clinical trials registry platform), provide the registry name and number (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01234567) at the end of the Abstract and again in Materials & Methods.
*   **Data Sharing Statement:** Include one of the following statements verbatim on the full title page:
    *   Data generated by the authors or analyzed during the study are available at: (author provides citation to data).
    *   Data analyzed during the study were provided by a third party. Requests for data should be directed to the provider indicated in the Acknowledgments.
    *   Data generated or analyzed during the study are available from the corresponding author by request.
    *   All data generated or analyzed during the study are included in the published paper.
    *   No data were generated or analyzed during the study.

## 10. Systematic Review and/or Meta-Analysis Papers
*   **Search Details:** Specify databases searched and exact search terms used.
*   **Exclusions:** Indicate why records were excluded from your study.
*   **Flow Diagram:** Include a flow diagram as Figure 1 in your results, showing the initial number of records identified through database searching and those excluded for any reason, documenting the number excluded for each reason.

## 11. Results (1000 words)
*   **Completeness:** Give results for all items mentioned in the Materials and Methods.
*   **Headings:** Results headings should mirror Materials and Methods subheadings, as appropriate.
*   **First Paragraph:** Should be titled *Patient Characteristics* or *Participant Characteristics*.
    *   Summarize characteristics of patients/participants. At a minimum, indicate number, mean age $\pm$ SD or median age and IQR, and number of men vs women. Cite Table 1.
    *   Document the number of patients/participants excluded for each exclusion criterion described in methods. Cite Figure 1 flow diagram.

*   **Data Presentation:**
    *   Regression coefficients or mean values of compared groups must be given along with p-values for all comparisons (e.g., group A, 25 $\pm$ 4, group B 50 $\pm$ 5, p=.01).
    *   Report the results for all variables collected and analyzed, not just for those which exhibited statistical significance. Give all p-values, even if non-significant.
    *   Report the numerator and denominator for percentages: sensitivity 20 of 25 (80%).
    *   Include confidence intervals: (AUC, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.77; P < .001).
*   **"Significant" Terminology:**
    *   Define the level of statistical significance (e.g., p < .05) in your Methods, statistical analysis section.
    *   Thereafter, minimize repeating "significant" or "significantly." Simply state the p-value.
    *   Use "significant" only in the statistical sense. Delete unless referring to something being *clinically significant* or having *clinical significance*, using that exact wording.
*   **Nonsignificant Results:** Do not write "There was no difference between groups A and B." Write "We found no evidence of a difference between groups A and B."

## 12. Discussion (800 words)

### 12.1. Discussion Structure
*   **Paragraph 1 (Summary):** Provide a succinct 1-paragraph summary of the entire study. Briefly restate the background (why the study was done). Then state the major findings. Instead of providing general statements that something was better or superior, provide specific metrics with data and p-values (key results).
*   **Paragraphs 2-4 (Context):** Briefly review what others have reported and why your findings are better/confirmatory/different. If multiple prior studies on the topic, consider including a small summary table of prior results in the literature.
*   **Second to Last Paragraph (Limitations):** State limitations of your study, such as sources of potential bias, statistical uncertainty, and generalizability. If a post-hoc analysis was performed, include it as a limitation.
*   **Last Paragraph (Conclusion & Future):** Restate the conclusion and offer what you think should be done in the future to advance the study. If an animal study, then discuss practical applications.

### 12.2. Exclusions
*   Do not include figures/tables.
*   Do not include any results not mentioned in the Results section. If you wish to include them in the Discussion, they must also be presented in the Results section with appropriate information in Materials and Methods (what was done, by whom, etc.).

## 13. References
*   **Limit:** Reference limit is 35 for original research. This limit is not applicable to meta-analyses.
*   **Personal Communication:** Avoid citations of personal communication.
*   **"Recent" References:** Do not refer to a reference as "recent" unless it is a newer study ($\le$5 years old).

## 14. Figures
*   **Numbering:** Number all figures in the order they first appear in the text.
*   **Captions:** For each figure, define all abbreviations in the caption and include all units. Each figure must be understood on its own.
*   **Graphs:** Each graph needs labels and units for x and and y axes. Do not use graph abbreviations unless full terms cannot fit on the axes.
*   **Color:** Include a labeled color bar for figures that use color.
*   **Histology:** For histologic sections, provide the stain used and the magnification.
*   **Labeling:** Label all features you describe in the captions. Review recently published articles in *Radiology* for the required degree of labeling.
*   **Arrowheads:** Avoid using equilateral triangles for arrowheads (difficult to determine labeling point).
*   **MRI:** For all MRI, include the specific pulse sequence information (e.g., TR, TE, etc.) in the caption if not described (or different) from that described in methods.
*   **Kaplan Meier Curves:** Add the censored data points and the number at risk below the graph.
*   **Box Plunger Plots:** Avoid box plunger plots. Present data as a box whisker plot or show actual data points in a box plot.
*   **Clinical Images:** Provide at least one or two actual scan images that demonstrate your main findings.
*   **Individual Patient/Participant Figures:** Include a separate figure for each individual patient/participant. Figure legends should include age, sex, clinical history/disease, type of image (e.g., CT, MRI, US), plane, and other relevant details such as whether contrast was used or not. Use present tense.

## 15. Tables
*   **Numbering:** Number all tables in the order they first appear in the text.
*   **Size:** Fit each table on one page. Limit main tables to no more than 40 rows and 6-8 columns.
*   **Headings:** Every column must have a heading and follow the same heading all the way down. Each row must follow the same heading all the way across.
*   **Variables:** Use rows for independent (X) variables, columns for dependent (Y) variables.
*   **Footnotes:** For each table, define all abbreviations and data values in a footnote and include all units of measure, if not already included. Each table must be understood on its own.
*   **Table 1: Demographic Characteristics of Study Sample:**
    *   For manuscripts with human participants, include a table of demographic characteristics.
    *   Minimum information: number and sex of participants, mean age $\pm$ SD or median age IQR, age range, and key clinical characteristics.
    *   Provide relevant covariates needed to describe participants (e.g., women: pre/postmenopausal status; cardiovascular disease: diabetes status, smoking.).
    *   If biologically reasonable and a large study, provide mean age $\pm$ SD or median age and IQR separately for men and women, in addition to giving the same information for all individuals as one group. Also, report any statistically significant differences in age between men and women.
*   **Multivariable Analysis Tables:**
    *   Include key parameters: regression coefficients, odds or hazard ratios with confidence intervals, and p-values.
    *   Include the number of events (n = \_\_).
    *   Indicate the number of participants dropped out due to missing data.

## 16. Common Issues & Terminology
*   **Area Under the ROC Curve:** Abbreviate as AUC, not AUROC.
*   **Biomarker:** Avoid overuse of the term "biomarker."
*   **CT Density:** Change "density" (for CT) to *attenuation*.
*   **Regression Terms:** Change "multivariate/univariate" to *multivariable/univariable*. A multivariable regression equation has multiple x variables and a single y (dependent) variable. If multiple Y variables in one equation, then multivariate may be (rarely) appropriate.
*   **Incomplete Reporting of Results:** Always report p-values with corresponding comparison values (e.g., group A, 25 $\pm$ 4, group B 50 $\pm$ 5, p=.01). Provide both numerical data and p-values for all comparisons.
*   **Accuracy vs. Performance:** AUC measures the *performance* of a model. Refer to "diagnostic performance" for AUC. Refer to "accuracy" when referring to accuracy percentage (fraction of predictions model got right).
*   **"Cases":** Limit the term "cases" when you could use a more specific word (e.g., *patients, participants, lesions*).
*   **Define All Terms:** Define all terms at first use. "Conventional" and "high resolution" MRI are vague; be specific (e.g., high spatial resolution or high temporal resolution). Terms such as "Ultra high resolution/Low dose/Ultra low dose" should be used sparingly and defined in Methods.
*   **"Correlated":** Use "correlated" only in the statistical sense and provide the correlation coefficient. Otherwise, use another appropriate word (e.g., associated, compared).
*   **Study Sample vs. Study Cohort vs. Population:**
    *   **Study sample:** A subset of the population.
    *   **Population:** The wide-ranging group of people to whom you aim to generalize the study results.
    *   **Study cohort:** Only appropriate for a longitudinal study that samples and observes a cohort over a period of time.

## 17. How to Present Numbers
*   **Excess Digits:** Remove excess digits.
    *   ADC should have up to three decimal places; greater precision is rare.
    *   AUC, ICC, and Kappa values should have 2 digits only (e.g., .82).
*   **Odds Ratios, Risk Ratios, Hazard Ratios:** Significant digits extending to the one hundredths place (e.g., 1.01, 5.26, 9.85, 0.15). Numbers extending beyond should be rounded.
*   **Correlation Coefficients:** Number of digits depends on the number of patients (e.g., correlation with 24 patients should have 2 digits of correlation; 243 patients could have 3 digits of correlation). Specify if r or r$^2$. If using standard correlation coefficients, then express as r$^2$.
*g., 22 of 50 = 44%, not 44.0%).
*   **Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, NPV, PPV:** Use percentages and avoid decimals (e.g., Sensitivity 85% rather than sensitivity 0.85).
*   **P-values:** Adjust all P values according to *Radiology* style:
    *   Use two digits for P values (unless providing Bonferroni-corrected P values) (e.g., p=.52; p=.04).
    *   If P value < .01, then use three digits (e.g., p=.005).
    *   For values close to .05, you may provide a third digit (i.e., .046).
    *   Give the exact P value unless < .001.
    *   Smallest P value should be <.001, largest >.99.
    *   Do not include leading zeros for P values.
    *   Avoid scientific notation:
        *   p = $5 \times 10^{-3}$ should be p=.005
        *   p = $5 \times 10^{-5}$ (0.00005) should be p<.001
        *   p = $6.2 \times 10^{-2}$ (0.062) should be p=.06
