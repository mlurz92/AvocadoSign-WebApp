### Beets-Tan et al. (2018) - ESGAR Consensus Guidelines Update

*   **Purpose:** To update the 2012 European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) consensus guidelines on the acquisition, interpretation, and reporting of MRI for the clinical management of rectal cancer.

*   **Methods:** Fourteen abdominal imaging experts participated in a formal consensus meeting using an adaptation of the RAND-UCLA Appropriateness Method. 246 items were scored and classified as 'appropriate', 'inappropriate', or 'uncertain' based on achieving ≥ 80% consensus.

*   **Key Findings:**
    *   Consensus was reached for 226 of 246 items (92%).
    *   MRI is mandatory for primary staging and restaging, except for early T1 tumors where endorectal ultrasound (EUS) is preferred for differentiating T1 from T2.
    *   A routine protocol should include 2D T2-weighted sequences in 3 planes and a diffusion-weighted (DWI) sequence with a b-value of ≥ 800.
    *   Structured reporting is recommended, and a template is provided.
    *   For organ preservation, restaging MRI findings must be correlated with clinical examination and endoscopy.
    *   No consensus was reached on the routine use of spasmolytics or endorectal filling.

*   **Nodal Malignancy Criteria (Primary Staging):** The panel proposed practical guidelines for nodal staging based on a combination of size and morphology on high-resolution (≤ 3 mm slice thickness) T2-weighted images. A node is considered malignant if it meets any of the following criteria:
    1.  Short axis diameter ≥ 9 mm.
    2.  Short axis diameter 5–8 mm AND has ≥ 2 morphologically suspicious characteristics.
    3.  Short axis diameter < 5 mm AND has all 3 morphologically suspicious characteristics.
    4.  It is a mucinous lymph node (any size).
    *   *Morphologically suspicious criteria are defined as: 1) Round shape, 2) Irregular border, and 3) Heterogeneous signal.*

*   **Nodal Malignancy Criteria (Restaging after nCRT):**
    *   All nodes with a short axis diameter < 5 mm should be considered benign.
    *   For nodes with a short axis diameter ≥ 5 mm, no reliable criteria exist, but as a practical guideline, they should be considered malignant.

*   **Conclusion:** These updated expert consensus recommendations provide clinical guidelines for using MRI in the primary staging and restaging of rectal cancer, with key additions regarding DWI, nodal staging criteria, and structured reporting.
