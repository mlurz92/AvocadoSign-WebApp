Thus, the trainee status of the first author should be stated in the Cover Letter.

### Original Research

These articles provide new knowledge based on original research. Meta-analyses are also acceptable/encouraged in this category. Studies should be hypothesis-driven and have well-described methods that can effectively answer the question addressed. These articles require appropriate statistical analyses. If your clinical trial has an assigned number, please provide. Possible registries include [**ClinicalTrials.gov**](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) or [**WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).**](http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/)

*   **Word count:** no more than 3000 words (Introduction to Discussion)
*   **Abstract:** Structured and no more than 300 words
*   **Reference Limit:** 35 (limit may be extended for meta-analyses)
*   **Figure Limit (images, charts, or graphs):** 6
*   **Table Limit:** 4
*   **Key Results:** Include up to 3 main results/conclusions from your study (maximum: 75 words) including summary data. Do NOT repeat your summary statement. Key Results will translate directly to visual abstracts. Please avoid using vague language and abbreviations in the Key Results. Obvious abbreviations like CT and MRI are fine.
*   **Required Summary Statement:** 1 sentence summarizing the important findings of your manuscript (maximum: 30 words).
*   **Demographics Table:** For manuscripts with human study participants, include a table of participant demographics/characteristics. This should be Table 1 of your paper. Minimum information should include number and sex of participants, mean age ± standard deviation (SD) or median age and interquartile range (IQR) and key clinical characteristics.
*   **Flow Diagram:** Include a diagram (figure 1 of your paper) showing initial number of participants and those excluded for any reason. Document the number excluded for each reason.
*   **Applicable Checklist:** Required as appropriate for studies involving human patients.
*   **Race and Ethnicity Reporting:** If race and ethnicity categories were collected, include the source of the classifications used (e.g., self-report or selection, investigator observed, database, electronic health record, survey) and why assessed (e.g., if required by a funding agency). In the results section, report specific participant race and ethnicity categories instead of collective terms like “other.” Categories should be listed in alphabetical order in text and tables. For tables, a footnote defining the categories of “other” would be sufficient. For additional information, see ["Updated Guidance on Reporting Race and Ethnicity in Medical and Science Journals."](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2783090)

### Technical Developments

Technical developments provide a brief description and results of new imaging techniques, procedures, or equipment. These are typically exploratory feasibility studies. These articles require appropriate statistical analyses. The Introduction and Discussion are more limited than in Original Research articles.

### Editorials

#### A. Targeted Editorials

Targeted Editorials are invited by the *Radiology* Editorial Office. These Editorials reflect the opinion of the author, who is an expert in the field. The purpose of these Editorials is to succinctly explain the importance of an Original Research report in the context of other work in the field. Editorials should be written so that a radiologist with general knowledge (rather than a subspecialist) will understand the topics being discussed. The first author must be the senior author who was invited by the Editorial Office. An additional author (2nd author) is permissible but only with approval of the Editorial Office.

**Note:** It is very important that editorials be written at the level of the general radiologist, rather than for the subspecialist.

*   **Word count:** 1200-1500 words
*   **Abstract:** None
*   **Reference Limit:** 5-10 (maximum)
*   **Figure Limit (individual images, charts, or graphs):** typically, no figures. In unusual circumstances, a single original figure or diagram may be acceptable.
*   **Number of tables:** typically, no tables. In unusual circumstances, a single brief table may be acceptable.
*   **Author biography:** 60-70 words (maximum)
*   **Author photo:** uploaded separately (minimum width of 1.5″ at 300 dpi)
*   **Funding information:** Include any funding information (If none: “Author declared no funding for this work.”)

Authors of Targeted Editorials are asked to include with their submission a brief author biography (60-70 words maximum). The biography should include institutional affiliation and any relevant information such as past and present positions, research interests, awards, etc. A photo of the author should be included. The biography can be added to the end of paper, in a section heading “Author biography”. See example below.

### *Radiology* Diagnosis Please®

These submissions are for the monthly feature of cases that are the basis of the annual *Radiology* Diagnosis Please® competition. Each case is presented as an “unknown” and is published in two parts. Part 1 has only the patient history and images with brief legends. Part 2 includes the diagnosis, discussion of the diagnosis, and the major considerations in differential diagnosis. Cases published in this section are to be challenging, and one should be able to make the most likely diagnosis on the basis of the imaging findings and the history, which is all that will be available to the reader when the case is presented.

If you are interested in submitting a *Radiology* Diagnosis Please® case, you must first complete the proposal below and email it to ***radiology@rsna.org***.

#### Proposal

Prior to submitting an article to *Radiology* Diagnosis Please®, the topic must be approved by the Editor through e-mail. Your e-mail to the Editor should supply the following information:

1.  What is the final diagnosis in the case?
2.  Why is the case challenging?
3.  Why should one make the most likely diagnosis based on the history and the imaging findings?
4.  What is the differential diagnosis?
5.  Are you able to say the other differential diagnostic considerations are less likely, based on what the reader will read and see (the history and the images)? Also, are you able to support your reasons with information from the published literature? If so, please provide up to three relevant references.
6.  By what date would you be able to submit this case?
7.  Please provide the corresponding author’s name, institution, and address.

#### Assembly of Part 1

This represents the material that is initially published. It consists of the history and four to six images labeled only with image type (for example, posteroanterior chest radiograph, contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen, conventional radiograph of the ankle, MR image of the elbow [with pulse sequence information]) but not with a description of the findings. With the history and images, the reader is to conclude what is the most likely diagnosis.

#### Assembly of Part 2

The text of this part is composed of several sections.

*   **History:** This is the same history as in part 1.
*   **Imaging Findings:** Give a narrative description of the imaging findings (the figure legends alone do not suffice for this section), with figures cited in the text.
*   **Discussion:** Provide a description of how the imaging findings, when coupled with the history, result in the most likely diagnosis. If a differential diagnosis is to be considered, each differential item should be excluded on the basis of the nuances of imaging findings or the historical information. Give a brief summary of the entity illustrated by this case, and indicate the proof of the most likely diagnosis.
*   **References:** Provide the salient references.
*   **Figures:** The same illustrations as in part 1 should be provided, but they should display labels identifying the salient features that are described in the figure legends that you also provide for these illustrations. If you wish to provide additional important illustrations (two or three) to support your discussion, you may do so.

#### Submission

If approved, submit part 1 and part 2 as two separate manuscripts. Part 1 will be published in a given month to allow our readers to submit the most likely diagnosis. Part 2, published 4 months later, gives and discusses the actual diagnosis. At the end of part 2, we also list the names of those who submitted the correct most likely diagnosis.

*   **Word count:** no more than 1500 words
*   **Abstract:** None
*   **Reference Limit:** 10 (no references for Part 1)

Case Series should be particularly original, such as the “first” cases of a disease or condition (such as the first human CT scan of H1N1, the first ultrasound of a patient infected with Zika virus). Upon submission, these will undergo a screening process for potential suitability prior to peer review. Only those cases judged to have sufficient clinical impact will undergo a full peer-review process.

*   **Word count:** no more than 1500 words (Introduction to Discussion)
*   **Abstract:** Unstructured and no more than 100 words
*   **Reference Limit:** 20

The [**Scientific Style Guide**](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/radiology/author-instructions/scientificediting) is an accumulation of the mistakes and omissions observed over thousands of submissions to Radiology. While some parts of the Style Guide focus on our unique RSNA journal format, the majority is based on the AMA Manual of Style ([**https://www.amamanualofstyle.com**](https://www.amamanualofstyle.com/)) and will apply to any scientific paper. We strongly urge authors to browse the Style Guide for tips to help construct their submission.

### Top 10 Tips for Writing Your Scientific Paper

*   [**Tables (embedded, one per page)**](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/radiology/author-instructions#tables)

#### Authorship

*Radiology* does not allow multiple corresponding authors. Each manuscript can only have two first authors and two senior authors. For articles with a large list of authors (e.g., >30), all authors names may not fit on the PDF version of the article. In such cases, a group byline will be recommended with the individual names of each author listed at the end of the article. All authors names will still be individually indexed, displaced, and easily searchable in bibliographic records such as PubMed.

In instances of financial support of an author’s study by industry, information should be included at the beginning of the Materials and Methods section of the text. Authors should indicate (a) the name of the industry providing support for the study, (b) the type of support (financial, provision of equipment or contrast agents, etc), and (c) that the authors had control of the data and information submitted for publication. For authors who are employees of or consultants to the industry providing support, it must be clearly stated that the nonemployee or nonconsultant authors had control of the data and information that might present a conflict of interest for the other employee or consultant authors. Statements regarding control of data and information are also needed for any authors who are employees of or consultants to an industry whose products are being evaluated in the study, even if the industry did not support the study.

At the Editor’s discretion, industry supported trials with solely industry authors may be accepted for publication if: 1) the protocol was clearly defined a priori and is available for review in a nationally recognized registry, such as [**clinicaltrials.gov**](https://clinicaltrials.gov/); 2) anonymized original data are available for review at the Editor’s discretion. Any other nonfinancial conflicts of interest should also be disclosed to the Editor, with the understanding that the information may be published if deemed appropriate by the Editor.

Please see our [**Conflicts of Interest**](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/policies#conflicts) policy for more information.

#### Text Formatting and Style

*   Text should be submitted as Office 2010 (or later) Microsoft Word format.
*   Double space all text with adequate margins and do not right justify.
*   Use basic fonts such as Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman at 11 points.
*   Create special or mathematical characters and Greek letters using the symbol font.
*   Embed equations where cited in text.
*   Do not number the pages of the manuscript. They will be automatically numbered during the conversion to PDF format.
*   Avoid laboratory slang and clinical jargon.
*   Avoid self-evaluation of your work, for example, “novel,” “unique,” “ground-breaking.”
*   Consider your audience. Confirm your text is clear to a radiologist not in your specialty.
*   Avoid self-references due to anonymized review: “In our prior study… (ref XX)”

#### Units/Abbreviations

*   Use the International System of Units (SI) for radiation measurements and laboratory values. (See “SI Units in Radiation Protection and Measurements, NCRP report no. 82” [August 1985]; “Now Read This: The SI Units Are Here” [[**JAMA 1986;255:2329–2339**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.1986.03370170093043)]).
*   Spell out abbreviations when first used in the abstract and text—for example, “cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).” Obvious abbreviations like MRI, CT, PET, US do not need to be spelled out.
*   A maximum of 10 abbreviations are allowed. An abbreviation should only be used if the term appears at least five times in your manuscript.
*   Avoid nonstandard terms or abbreviations.
*   Define all abbreviations used in figures and tables in the legend.
*   Do not use abbreviations in the Summary Statement, Key Results, abstract conclusion, and first and last paragraph of discussion.

#### Double-Anonymized

*   The Abbreviated Title Page must be anonymized.
*   *Do not self-identify your prior work.* For example, do not state “as we have previously described,” [author’s reference]. Instead, suitable language would be, “Prior studies have shown…“ [reference].
*   Do not mention the author(s)’ institution or funding information in the manuscript.
*   Anonymize the author(s)’ initials if they are readers.

However, do not anonymize:

*   Clinical trial names and registration numbers (e.g., NCT number on clincialtrials.gov)
*   Study name (“The MESA study…” “The ADVANCE registry…”)
*   IRB numbers (Do not include your institution name.)
*   Software names
*   References – *No references should be deleted*.

#### Cover Letter

Prepare a separate cover letter for your submission. Your cover letter should include:

*   Title of the manuscript
*   Complete author list
*   For manuscripts with two first authors, submit a brief statement of explanation for why equal author contribution is warranted (REQUIRED).
*   State whether or not the first author is a trainee, i.e. resident or fellow in diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine or radiation oncology (REQUIRED for Original Research, Technical Developments, and Research Letters).
*   Description of any subject overlap with previously published works (REQUIRED)
    *   Your subject overlap statement should include prior published studies as well as work currently undergoing review or in press at a journal where subjects overlap with the current manuscript. Subject overlap means that the patients, animals, or experiments have been previously reported. Explain what is new and different about your current analysis. EXAMPLE: “In a prior study, we reported on 50 patients included in the current study. The prior report evaluated tumor response. The current study expands on this by having a larger patient number and includes new analyses of survival.”
    *   During the submission process, include PDFs of articles where the subject overlap occurred.
    *   Please note that subject overlap should also be reported in the Materials and Methods section of your paper.
*   Description of any conflict of interest or industry support of the project (REQUIRED)
*   Confirmation of sole submission to *Radiology* (REQUIRED)
*   Explanation of circumstances if authors are requesting fast-track and/or dual first authorship
*   The RSNA provides social media coverage of journal articles. If you or any of your co-authors have Twitter or Facebook accounts, please provide those handles. Alternatively, you may provide social media handles used by your department or institution.

#### Full Title Page

Prepare a separate Full Title Page for your submission. Your Full Title Page should include:

*   The title of the manuscript (15 words)
*   The first and last names, middle initials, academic degrees, and institutions of all authors
*   The name and street address of the institution from which the work originated
*   The telephone number, e-mail address, and complete address (name, street address, postal or zip code) of the corresponding author
*   Any funding information
*   Manuscript Type
*   Word Count for Text
*   Data sharing statement. See [**/page/policies\#clinical**](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/policies#clinical) for details.

#### Abbreviated Title Page (Anonymized)

*   Title of the manuscript (15 words) Include modality and disease. Be concise. If space allows, indicate study type (randomized clinical trial) and registry or clinical trial name (eg, MESA, DETERMINE)
*   Article Type
*   A summary statement (for Original Research and Technical Development papers) of no more than 30 words in **boldface**. This should be a single sentence that highlights the key finding in your study.
*   Key Results, consisting of up to 3 main results/conclusions from your study (maximum: 75 words) including summary data. Do NOT repeat your summary statement. Key Results will translate directly to visual abstracts. Please avoid using vague language and abbreviations in the Key Results. Obvious abbreviations like CT and MRI are fine. Type “N/A” if your study has none.
*   List of all abbreviations with spelled out words (no more than 10)

#### Abstract

##### Structured Abstract: Original Research and Technical Developments

Original Research and Technical Developments manuscripts must include a structured abstract of 300 words or less divided into five sections.

*   **Background:** Include 1-2 sentences stating why your study was performed and/or why it is relevant.
*   **Purpose:** In one to two sentences, succinctly state the study purpose.
*   **Materials and Methods:** (1) Identify as prospective or retrospective; (2) Date range of study; (3) If animal, study, provide number and type of animals; (4) Describe various groups, including controls; (5) Describe procedures performed; (6) Specifics of evaluation should parallel the results portion of the abstract; (7) Include one sentence on statistical analyses
*   **Results:** The first sentence should indicate the number, sex, and mean age ± standard deviation or median age and interquartile range (whole numbers only) of the study participants enrolled. For example, if there are 100 patients of 60 men and 40 women, then write 100 patients (mean age, 47 years +/- 10 [standard deviation]; 60 men) were evaluated. Provide sex of the larger number of patients. Then, provide the findings in parallel with the Methods and include indicators of statistical significance, actual numbers, and percentages. Report the numerator and denominator for all percentages. All p-values need corresponding comparison values. Include confidence intervals when appropriate.
*   **Conclusion:** Must derive directly from the results. Do not elaborate on the significance or other implications of your study. Must address the purpose of the study.

##### Unstructured Abstract: Review Articles, Case Series

Unstructured abstracts of 100 to 200 words that summarize the content of the submission in a single paragraph. Do not include specific headings or sections. Follow instructions for each particular article type.

#### Main Body

Original Research, Technical Development, and Case Series articles use the following headings: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, and Discussion. Authors may want to add subheadings to the Materials and Methods and Results sections for clarity purposes.

##### Introduction

No more than 400 words. Typically contains background information and references that inform the reader as to why the study was performed. No extensive literature review. Brevity and focus are important. In the final paragraph, state the hypothesis (for prospective studies only) and purpose. Your purpose should be essentially the same as in the abstract. Do not provide a hypothesis for retrospective studies, meta-analysis/systematic reviews, or technical development papers.

##### Materials and Methods

No more than 800 words. Include all items presented in the Results section.

The Materials and Methods section should include:

*   A clear statement of whether the study is retrospective or prospective. If main prospective study did not include your study purpose in original design, you may classify as a secondary analysis of a prospective trial.
*   For prospective studies, enrolled patients become participants. Refer to them as such.
*   Date range of the study.
*   Sample selection: Describe inclusion and exclusion criteria, consecutive or random selection.
*   Indicate how sample size was derived.
*   Number, training, and expertise of persons executing and reading the index tests. State the number of years of experience of those who performed readings or evaluations. For resident readings, indicate “in-training.”
*   Provide initials for any authors executing index tests or performing readings/evaluations. If those contributors are not authors, mention in [**acknowledgments**](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/radiology/author-instructions#acknowledgments) but obtain written permission to do so.
*   What was evaluated and how was evaluation performed? Mention anonymizing of data or images used in your analysis. Indicate if studies were read independently, if consensus agreements were used, and how disagreements were handled. Single observer studies are discouraged, as are “consensus” reads.
*   Description of the pre-specified primary outcome measure(s), as well as secondary and other variables.

For prospective and retrospective studies using human subjects, address in the first paragraph (1) Institutional review board (IRB) approval and patient informed consent. State if consent was obtained; (2) HIPAA compliance for U.S. studies; (3) Clinical Trials Registry Number and Registry Name. Mention whether all or part of your patient population was previously reported with citation of the appropriate reference(s). At the editor’s discretion, we may request a copy/verification of IRB/institutional review approval of your study prior to acceptance.

For animal experiments, provide a statement of approval by the institutional animal care committee or appropriate substitute (see the [**Human and Animal Studies**](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/radiology/author-instructions/policies#animal) section). If the portion of the animals was previously reported, please indicated the reference.

Describe clearly the number (if animals) and selection of the subjects studied (patients or experimental animals, including controls). Identify any utilized instruments or drugs (including contrast) with trade names, manufacturer’s name in parentheses. Describe procedures in sufficient detail to allow others to reproduce the study. It is essential to explain the manner in which studies were evaluated: independent readings, anonymized or unanonymized to other information, time sequencing between readings of several studies of the same subject to eliminate recall bias, random ordering of studies.

Give references to established methods, including statistical methods that have been published but are not well known; describe new or substantially modified methods and give reasons for using these techniques.

Last Paragraph: State the statistical methods used to analyze the data. Mention the statistical software used, along with version and manufacturer's name. State the p-value used for significance. If statistical analyst is an author, then provide initials. A statement of justification of sample size and/ or power calculation is strongly recommended.

*Radiology* recommends that authors seek statistical consultation before planning a study to ensure appropriate enrollment and collection of data and the use of statistical tools. Similarly, discuss studies relating to cost analysis or cost-effectiveness with individuals knowledgeable in these techniques. *Radiology* reserves the right to have the raw data recalculated by our consultants, as needed. Background information on statistical analyses may be included in the [**Supplemental Materials**](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/radiology/author-instructions#supplemental_material) when it is essential for understanding the study.

##### Results

No more than 1000 words. The first paragraph should summarize the demographics of your study sample. At a minimum, indicate number of patients/participants, mean age ± standard deviation or median age and interquartile range, and number of men vs women. For manuscripts with human study participants, include a table of demographics/characteristics. This should be Table 1 of your paper. The first paragraph of Results should summarize and cite the table 1 demographics. Also, document the number of participants excluded for each exclusion criteria described in methods. Include a flow diagram as Figure 1 and cite in the Results, showing initial number of participants and those excluded for any reason.

Present the results in logical sequence in the text, along with tables and illustrations. Summarize important observations with reference to appropriate tables and figures. Give results for all items mentioned in the Materials and Methods. Use Materials and Methods subheadings in the same sequence in the Results, as appropriate.

State the statistical significance of the findings. Report the results of the statistical analyses for all variables collected and analyzed, not just for those which exhibited statistical or near statistical significance. Avoid hedge terms such as “trend” or “marginal” for results that are not statistically significant.

Provide numerators and denominators for all percentages, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Regression coefficients or mean values of compared groups must be given along with p-values.

P-values should be expressed to 2 digits to the right of the decimal point (regardless of whether the p-value is significant) unless p <.01 in which case the p-value should be expressed to 3 digits to the right of the decimal point. The exception to this rule is when rounding p from 3 digits to 2 digits would result in p appearing non-significant (such as p=.046). Give exact p-value unless <.001. The smallest p-value that should be expressed is <.001. The largest p-value is >.99.

##### Discussion

No more than 800 words. Do not repeat in detail the data given in the Results section. Do not cite tables or figures in the discussion. These should be introduced in the Materials and Methods and Results sections.

The first paragraph should briefly restate the problem that you studied and the primary results. Provide a succinct one paragraph summary of your entire study: briefly restate the background for your study and why it was done. Then state your major findings. Instead of providing general statements that something was generally better or superior, provide specific metrics (key results) and p-values that support your statements.

Include implications of the findings and their limitations, in particular with reference to the use of modified methods, statistical or otherwise. Relate the observations to other relevant studies. Link the conclusions with the goals of the study, but avoid unqualified statements and conclusions not supported completely by the data. Avoid claiming priority and alluding to or giving the results of ongoing investigations that have not been completed or that are not part of the study. State new hypotheses when warranted, but clearly label them as such.

The second to last paragraph of this section should address study limitations. The final paragraph should summarize your results and findings; if appropriate, offer what you think should be done in the future to advance your study.

##### Supplemental Materials

Present background information, mathematical derivations, and statistical analyses when essential for the understanding of the study. Include in the appropriate section of the text (for example, Materials and Methods, Results) a brief summary of the information contained in the Supplemental Materials and make reference to the Supplemental Materials.

#### Tables

*   Prepare tables in Microsoft Word and attach them to the end of the text document.
*   Each table should be on a separate page and have a short, descriptive title.
*   Each table should be limited to no more than 40 rows and 6-8 columns.
*   Number each table in Arabic numerals.
*   Each table should be cited in numeric order in the main text.
*   When indicating values such as sensitivity, specificity, provide these as X/Y (%); give the numerator and denominator.
*   Supply information on statistical variability when applicable. (For example, provide standard deviations for mean values or confidence intervals etc as appropriate.)
*   Tables must be understandable by themselves without reference to the results section.
*   Do not use the merged cell feature of Word. Use subheadings instead.
*   Every column must have a heading.
*   Each column must follow the same heading all the way down.
*   Each row must follow the same heading all the way across.
*   Tables must have more than one row. If there is no need for more than one row in a table, the information in that table should instead be incorporated into the text.
*   The same data should be presented consistently (eg, to the same number of significant digits) throughout the abstract, text, tables, figures, and supplements.
*   Each item of data should be contained within its own cell.
*   Use rows for independent (x) variables; use columns for dependent (y) variables.
*   All abbreviations used in tables need to be defined in the footnotes of each table.

*Example of a Published Table (description):* A table typically includes columns for variables (e.g., Patient Characteristics, Imaging Findings, Outcome) and rows for data entries. Footnotes are used to define abbreviations and provide additional context or statistical notes.

#### Figure Legends

*   For new submissions, figure legends should appear directly after the relevant figure in the combined figure text document. For revised manuscripts, all figure legends should appear collectively at the end of the main document.
*   Include appropriate figure legends for all figures, including drawings and graphs.
*   All abbreviations used in figures and figure legends need to be defined in the figure legend.
*   Do not duplicate text material.
*   For images of human subjects, the legend must include the age, sex, and clinical history/disease of the patient, if relevant to the figure.
*   For studies on animals, the legend must include the type of animal (and age, weight, and/or diagnosis, if appropriate).
*   The legend must describe all labels placed on an illustration.
*   The legend must include the type of image, its plane, whether or not contrast material was used, the pulse sequence information for MR images (in general, full details of the MR sequences should be given in the methods not in the legend), and the features to be observed by the reader.
*   For photomicrographs, include the stain and original magnification.
*   Use scale markers where appropriate.
*   For drawings and graphs, the legend must state the important points to be observed.

#### Figures

##### For Original Submissions

*   For new submissions, figures should be combined into one Word document in the order they appear in the text, with figure legends immediately following the relevant figure.
*   Crop figures to area of interest. Allow enough surrounding area for assessment of pertinent anatomic information (for example, to illustrate a cavity at the right lung apex, show only that area, rather than the entire chest radiograph).
*   Number figures (figure 1, figure 2) and include no more than four components (a, b, c, d) for each figure.
*   Multipart figures should be combined to appear on the same page.
*   Label all features described in the figure legend. Use different labels for each feature.
*   Exclude patient and subject identifying information
*   Use same magnification for multiple images of a given type (for example, CT, MR, US) or view (posteroanterior and lateral). Use the tonal relations of the original radiograph (such as bones white on a dark background, with the patient’s right to the observer’s left; for CT scans and MR images employ the “view from below”).
*   Limit to required figures showing essential features described in the manuscript. Do not include redundant or excessive figures.
*   Include separate figures for individual patients. Figure legends should include age, sex, clinical history/disease, imaging modality, plane, and other relevant details such as whether contrast was used or not.
    *   *Example:* Image in a 65-year-old man with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia admitted to intensive care unit. Unenhanced axial chest CT image shows bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities (arrows) with random distribution and peripheral bandlike consolidation in the right lower lobe (arrowhead), with visual quantification of the well-aerated lung of 35%. (Adapted from [**/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020201433)**](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020201433)
*   **Enhancements:** if a figure has been enhanced electronically, explain the alterations made and send an original image along with the enhanced one.
*   Additional figures may be submitted as supplemental material. [**See Supplemental Material**](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/radiology/author-instructions#supplemental_material)
*   *Radiology* discourages the use of previously published figures unless absolutely essential as the publisher may require you to pay a fee and may not provide permission for electronic publication in the online version of *Radiology*.
*   Figure arrays are done by RSNA professional artists’ service, provided to *Radiology* authors without charge.
*   View the short video tutorials below: (1) How to Save Images off of PACS (selecting key images, removing annotation, saving image as a TIF file) and (2) How to Prepare Your Images in Photoshop (cropping the image, adjusting contrast and brightness, adjusting size and resolution, adding arrows)

##### How to Save Images off of PACS

Topics: Selecting key images, removing annotation, saving image as a TIF file

##### How to Prepare Your Images in Photoshop

Topics: cropping the image, adjusting contrast and brightness, adjusting size and resolution, adding arrows

##### Collages

*   *Radiology* accepts figures grouped as a collage if the relationship requires arrows/tags to convey meaning.
*   For original submissions, combine parts so they appear on one page for review.
*   For revised submissions, upload each part separately, with the following parameters:
    *   Use Photoshop and keep all layers when creating the TIF file.
    *   Resolution: minimum of 300 dpi if substantial text/labeling.
    *   Size: 3 inches for each image.
    *   Labels: san-serif font, such as Arial, bold, point size 12 or larger.

##### For Revised Manuscripts

For revisions, figures should be uploaded individually, not in a combined document. Number and label figures consecutively in the order in which they are cited in the manuscript. Ensure that the file name contains the figure number. (e.g., Figure 1.tif; Figure 2a.tif, Figure 3.eps) When uploading image files into Manuscript Central/ScholarOne, please insert the figure legend into the caption box. Begin each caption with the word “Figure” followed by the figure number and figure part, if applicable. (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 2a). If figures are multi-part, submit each figure part as a separate figure file and enter a separate legend/citation for each part (eg, Figure 1, Figure 2A, Figure 2B).

##### Photographic/halftone image scans (grayscale or color):

*   Formats: PSD (Photoshop), TIF, AI, and EPS, unflattened vector files. PNG files are not accepted.
*   Resolution: 300 dpi
*   Size: minimum of 3 inches to a maximum of 7 inches.
*   Labels/arrows: professional quality placed on a separate layer of the image file (do not merge or flatten), and must touch edge of the feature being labeled (do not use equilateral triangles for arrowheads).
*   Do *not* send as Word or PowerPoint document. If so, pixel resolution will be lost.

##### Graphs/Illustrations:

Graphs, illustrations, and drawings rendered in professional graphics programs should be submitted in Photoshop (.psd), TIFF (.tif), Powerpoint (.ppt), AI (.ai), or encapsulated Postscript (.eps) format at 1200 dpi. Layers should be retained (do not "flatten" the image), and image should not be upsampled. If the graph or illustration was created in Excel or Word, we recommend that you submit the original file in the native format, which can be rendered as high-resolution images by RSNA.

##### Using Color in Images

While RSNA encourages the use of color keys in your images, graphs, and illustrations please use the following [**Colorblindness Accessibility Guide**](https://pubs.rsna.org/pb-assets/Radiology/PIA/ColorblindnessAccessibilityGuide-1642096368970.pdf) to choose a color palette when possible. The color palettes should be considered when using color to differentiate data in graphs, or when several colored keys are used in an image. Radiologic/pathologic images do not need to be altered. You can also place your images in the [**Color Blindness Simulator (Coblis)**](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) to see if your colors will be easily discernable. See [**here**](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/radiology/blog/2023/5/ryblog_05192023) for more information on the use of color in figures.

#### Protected Health Information (PHI)

In all instances, patient confidentiality must be protected. No patient names, hospital ID numbers, or any other information that allows the patient to be identified should appear in images or illustrations, including in the original image file names. Crop all images to remove identifying information prior to importing them into your manuscript or presentation.

“Hidden” PHI may still be identifiable to search engines. Whenever possible, PHI should be fully removed from the image rather than hidden. In Photoshop, if a “black bar” or other visual aid is used to obscure PHI, image layers must be “flattened” to remove the information from the image metadata. Images should be cropped prior to inserting into PowerPoint presentations. Images cropped within PowerPoint should be flattened with the Compress Pictures tool. For more help, see these [**step-by-step instructions**](https://pubs.rsna.org/pb-assets/Radiology/PIA/PHI_Removal_stepbystep_instructions-1605304008593.pdf).

#### Checklist (STARD, CONSORT, PRISMA, or STROBE)

Upon initial submission of Original Research and Technical Development papers that involve human subjects, you will be required to choose the checklist that is applicable to your study from the list below. Checklists are not required for animal studies. It may be that not all checklist items are appropriate for a study, in which case you should mark the item “not applicable.” Note: Your paper will be sent back if this checklist is not included upon first submission.

1.  For studies dealing with diagnostic accuracy, use the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy ([**STARD**](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/stard/)) ([***Radiology*** **2015; doi:10.1148/radiol.2015151516**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2015151516)), as well as the presentation from the RSNA 2015 Annual Meeting [**Understanding and Using the STARD and PRISMA Guidelines**](http://pubs.rsna.org/pb/assets/raw/Radiology/PIA/Courses/Understanding%20and%20Using%20the%20STARD%20and%20PRISMA%20Guidelines.pdf) (PDF).

Use of checklists allows authors to describe their work more effectively, aiding the detailed scientific review of their work and its key results and implications for future biomedical research. This critical evaluation also aids authors in the discussion of the limitations and biases inherent in their study. ([***Radiology*** **2016;278:6–10**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2015152256))

#### Supplemental Material

##### Submission of Supplemental Material

Authors may provide supplemental material to give readers additional information about the work. This material can include (1) multimedia (such as animation, dynamic image sets [movies], audio); (2) large numbers of relevant images whose number would exceed the limits of the article PDF; (3) relevant data in the form of tables or text that could not be accommodated in the article PDF; (4) interactive materials such as Java applets and other programs for expanding browser capabilities and interactivity in areas such as image display and computer-assisted instruction; (5) algorithms; (6) Jupyter notebooks; and (7) annotated image sets.

To be considered for publication, supplemental material must be submitted electronically through our [**manuscript submission system**](https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rad) along with the main article. Supplemental text, tables, and figures (with legends) should be compiled in one Word document, separate from the main body manuscript file, and uploaded as a “Supplemental File for Review.” Movies and audio should be uploaded separately and labeled as “Multimedia.” Permission letters required for any of the supplemental material must also be uploaded.

Supplemental Material is not copyedited. Authors are responsible for the accuracy and presentation of the content.

##### Preparation of Supplemental Material

*   **Text:** Text should be submitted in Word included together with any supplemental tables and figures, and uploaded as a “Supplemental File for Review.”
*   **Images:** Figures and legends should be submitted in Word, included together with any supplemental text and tables, and uploaded as a “Supplemental File for Review.”
*   **Movies:** Movie files and animations will be accepted in the widely implemented standard formats MPEG (.mpg, .mpeg), QuickTime (.mov), AVI (.avi), Windows Media Video (.wmv). Submission in mp4 format would be best, as all movies are converted to those formats so that they will play on mobile devices. GIF animations are also acceptable in some cases. Audio should be provided as an mp3 file. File compression and/or dimension limits should be used on movies to keep them at a reasonable size (less than 30 MB) unless there is a compelling reason for larger files. Each movie requires a legend, and the movie and legend text should be part of the submission.
*   **Equations:** Mathematical equations and expressions can be submitted as images, as math objects, or as simple text, if possible.
*   **Tables:** Tables should be submitted in Word, included together with any supplemental text and figures, and uploaded as a “Supplemental File for Review.”

The Author Contribution form, in which authors identify the manuscript contributions for which they are responsible, is sent automatically by e-mail immediately after manuscript submission. Contact the *Radiology* Editorial Office (***radiology@rsna.org***) with any questions.

The Transfer of Copyright and Certifications Agreement for all proffered works is also sent automatically by e-mail immediately after manuscript submission. In the case of officers or employees of the U.S. government, the Society recognizes that works prepared as part of their official government duties are in the public domain, but authors must still sign the Copyright and Certifications Agreement. Contact the *Radiology* Editorial Office (***radiology@rsna.org***) with any questions.

Authors will be asked to complete an ICMJE conflict of interest disclosure form before the final acceptance of the manuscript.

### Instructions for Submission of Revised Manuscripts

When you prepare a revised version of your manuscript, it is essential that you carefully follow the instructions given in the Editor’s letter. If there are discrepancies between what is below and what is in the decision letter, follow the instructions in the letter. Use the standard uploading format (as described for [**original submissions**](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/radiology/author-instructions#originalsubmission)), but include both a clean copy of your manuscript and an annotated copy describing the changes you have made. Make sure to select the appropriate file designations for these two versions (Main Body and Annotated Main Body). Failure to do so will cause a delay in the review of your revision. Note that both the Main Body and Annotated Main Body will be sent to reviewers should your manuscript be sent for re-review. Both versions need to be anonymized. Failure to do so may cause reviewers to know your identity. Anonymize any identifying information such as author names, titles, initials, and institutions. Also, If citing your work, avoid the first person (we previously demonstrated). Instead, use the third person (Smith et al have demonstrated). Instructions on changing your displayed name in comments and tracked changes can be found [**here**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-the-author-name-for-documents-presentations-or-workbooks-0ad23fe7-b82e-40c4-b9d9-391fec971a54). Change the name you display to Author. Do not use your real name.

If references, tables, or figures are moved, added, or deleted during the revision process, renumber them to reflect such changes so that all tables, references and figures are cited in numeric order.

Upload individual high resolution figures files at revision. See [figures](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/radiology/author-instructions#revisedfigures).

#### Creating a Revision

If you wish to submit a revision of your manuscript, click on the Create a Revision link in the Manuscripts with Decisions list. This will create a new manuscript record with the same manuscript ID but with .R1 or .R2 appended at the end.

If a revision is started, the Create a Revision link will no longer appear in the Manuscripts with Decisions list, and the list will indicate that a revision exists and the revision's manuscript ID. The option will reappear if you delete the revision before it is actually submitted. The draft of the revised manuscript is located in the Revised Manuscripts in Draft list.

Once you click the Create a Revision link, you will receive a confirmation asking you if you are sure you want to create a new revised manuscript. If you click Cancel, the action will be aborted. If you click OK, you will be taken to the first step in the revision submission process, the View & Respond to Comments step.

#### Forms

If the Author Contribution Form and the Transfer of Copyright and Certifications Agreement are not completed at the time of revision, processing of the revision will be held until all forms are complete.

Each author should have submitted with the original submission an Author Contribution Form in which authors identify the manuscript contributions for which they are responsible. Contact the *Radiology* Editorial Office (***radiology@rsna.org***) with any questions.

The Transfer of Copyright and Certifications Agreement should have been signed by all authors with initial submission of all proffered works. In the case of officers or employees of the U.S. government, the Society recognizes that works prepared as part of their official government duties are in the public domain; but they must still sign the Copyright and Certifications Agreement. Contact the *Radiology* Editorial Office (***radiology@rsna.org***) with any questions.

Authors will be asked to complete an ICMJE conflict of interest disclosure form before the final acceptance of the manuscript.

#### Revised Manuscript: What to Submit

##### Clean Version

If references, tables, or figures are moved, added, or deleted during the revision process, please renumber them to reflect such changes so that all tables, references and figures are cited in numerical order.

##### Annotated Version

The annotated copy should have highlights on the changes (either by using Track Changes function in Microsoft Word or by highlighting or underlining text) with notes in the text referring to the Editor or reviewer query (for example, highlighted text [R2.2] would be the second comment from reviewer 2, and highlighted text [E1.4] would be the fourth comment from the Editor). Be sure when you upload your annotated version that the changes are clearly visible on the PDF file prior to resubmission.

The annotated version of your manuscript will be sent to reviewers should your manuscript be sent for re-review. It should be anonymized. Failure to do so may cause reviewers to know your identity. Anonymize any identifying information such as author names, titles, initials, and institutions. Also, If citing your work, avoid the first person (we previously demonstrated). Instead, use the third person (Smith et al have demonstrated). Instructions on changing your displayed name in comments and tracked changes can be found [**here**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-the-author-name-for-documents-presentations-or-workbooks-0ad23fe7-b82e-40c4-b9d9-391fec971a54). Change the name you display to Author. Do not use your real name.

##### Figures

For revisions, production quality figures should be uploaded individually, not in a combined document. Number and label figures consecutively in the order in which they are cited in the manuscript. Ensure that the file name contains the figure number. (e.g., Figure 1.tif; Figure 2a.tif, Figure 3.eps) When uploading image files into Manuscript Central/ScholarOne, please insert the figure legend into the caption box. Begin each caption with the word “Figure” followed by the figure number and figure part, if applicable. (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 2a). If figures are multi-part, submit each figure part as a separate figure file and enter a separate legend/citation for each part (eg, Figure 1, Figure 2A, Figure 2B).

##### Point-by-Point Response letter

A point-by-point response letter is required specifying how each of the Editor and reviewer comments have been addressed.

##### Confirmation of sole submission to *Radiology*

At the time of initial submission, authors are asked to attest that a manuscript on the same or similar material has not already been published by them or has not been or will not be submitted to another journal by them or by colleagues at their institution before their work appears in *Radiology*. At the time of submitting a revision, questions regarding overlapping content are again asked. The submission by authors of similar material to advertising, news media, or other forms of publication must be indicated at the time *Radiology* receives the revised manuscript, and a copy of that material should be provided with the submission.

### Manuscript Transfer between RSNA Journals

RSNA has a suite of journals, *Radiology: Artificial Intelligence*, *Radiology: Cardiothoracic Imaging*, *Radiology: Imaging Cancer*, and *Radiology Advances*. Papers submitted to *Radiology* but not accepted for publication may, in some cases, be eligible for publication in another of these journals. If your manuscript is rejected from *Radiology*, we would be happy to transfer your submission to the second journal. Editors at the second journal may use the information gathered during evaluation at *Radiology* to expedite review, including reuse of the reviews, provided reviewers agree. If your manuscript underwent peer review at *Radiology*, you may either edit your manuscript based on the reviewer recommendations or submit as is. If you make edits, please include a document explaining the changes made as well as a document with tracked changes. The editors at the second journal will review the manuscript, along with the comments from the *Radiology* reviewers, and will let you know what additional changes need to be made in a revised version.

The Editors may include an invitation to transfer in your decision letter. If you accept the transfer, you will be able to select any *Radiology* suite journal for transfer. Please note that some journals may not be suitable for your manuscript based on the scope of the particular journal and the content of the manuscript. If you choose to transfer, documents that were part of the review process at *Radiology* will be transferred to your Author Center at the second journal. Although the suggestion for manuscript transfer indicates interest in the manuscript, there is no guarantee that the transferred manuscript will be accepted. Manuscript transfers between RSNA journals are intended to ease the submission process and are entirely at the author’s discretion.

Please see our [**manuscript transfer FAQ**](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/ai/author-instructions/faq) for more information.

### Fast Track Pre-submission Program

*Radiology* is soliciting practice-changing image-related manuscripts that have undergone peer review by highly regarded medical/science journals (such as *NEJM, JAMA, Lancet, Nature, Science*) but were not accepted for publication. These image-focused papers may be better suited for a medical imaging journal such as *Radiology*. We are particularly interested in clinical trials and registries. We offer a new pathway for selected manuscripts to undergo accelerated review and decision. The editorial board will take into consideration the prior peer reviews.

Authors interested in this new accelerated program should submit:

1.  A cover letter summarizing the manuscript and explaining its suitability for the Fast Track Pre-submission Program. Specify how the authors revised the manuscript to address the prior journal’s concerns.
